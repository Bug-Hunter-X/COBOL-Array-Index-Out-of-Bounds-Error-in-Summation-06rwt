This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programming related to array indexing. The code attempts to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100, but incorrectly uses a fixed-size array that's too small. This leads to an array index out of bounds error. The solution provides a corrected version that uses a different, more appropriate approach for accumulating a sum. The example uses COBOL's PERFORM statement with a loop, which is a commonly used technique, but which can be implemented incorrectly if array sizing is not well understood. The example highlights a subtle yet significant programming error often overlooked by COBOL developers.  It serves as a valuable reminder about careful handling of array sizes and indices within the COBOL language.
